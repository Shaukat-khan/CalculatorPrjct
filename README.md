# CalculatorPrjct
Using basic java coding I was able to create a Calculator project where you were able to add, subtract, multiply, and divde numbers.

## Operands 
The operands used in this project were int and double for storing numbers. We also used Scanner whichc is a class in java.util package used for obtaining the input from the user. 

## Steps
We declared our operands and asked the user whether they wanted to add, subtract, multiply, or to divide the numbers. Once the user enter the option, then they would enter two numbers which would execute accordingly to the operation they chose.
